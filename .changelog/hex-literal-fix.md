Fix hex literal conversion to preserve `0x` prefix in concat expressions.

The naive `replace("'0x", "'\\x")` was incorrectly converting `concat('0x', ...)` to `concat('\x', ...)`, causing addresses to display as `\x...` instead of `0x...`. Now uses regex to only convert hex literals with 40+ characters.
